## How to Play

To Play:

This is your class Matching Game.  

- Select a card to reveal its symbol.
- Select a 2nd card to reveal its symbol.  If the cards are the same you have a match!
- If the cards don't match, they will be turned back over.  Try to remember where the cards are.
-  Select two more cards, trying to find matching symbols.
- You'll see how many moves you've made, seconds have past, and stars you've earned.
- Try and match all the cards in the least amount of time.
- You can play as many times as you want by pressing the Reset button.
