## How to Play

To Play:

This is a version of the classic Matching Game.  

- Select a card to reveal its symbol.
- Select a 2nd card to reveal its symbol.  If the cards are the same you have a match!
- If the cards don't match, they will be turned back over.  Try to remember where the cards are.
- Select two more cards, trying to find matching symbols.
- You'll see how many moves you've made, how many seconds have past, and how many stars you've earned.
- Try and match all the cards in the least amount of time and the least amount of moves.
- You can play as many times as you want by pressing the Play Again button.
